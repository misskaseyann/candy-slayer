# Candy Slayer
It seemed like a normal Halloween Eve. You bought a lot of candy, ate a lot of candy, and went to bed early. You had a lot trick-or-treating to do the next day.

Unfortunately, when you woke up you discovered that the world was not how you left it. Batches of bad candy had transformed your friends and neighbors into all sorts of crazy monsters. Somehow you missed the tainted candy; it is therefore up to you to save your neighborhood and turn everyone back to normal.
